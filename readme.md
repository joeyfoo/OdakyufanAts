# The OdakyufanAts Train Plugin

This repository contains a **mirror** of odakyufan' OdakyufanAts plugin. The original project page is located at http://odakyufan.zxq.net/odakyufanats/index.html, but the site is no longer online. 

These files were provided by odakyufan via email communication back in November 2015. The source code and documentation has been published mostly as-is, however there was no specific version number attached to the files provided (the `AssemblyInfo.cs` suggests the version number is `1.0.*`).
