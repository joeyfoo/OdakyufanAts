Additional devices include the EB and TASC.</div><div> In addition to safety systems, OdakyufanAts supports calling out signal aspects and speed restrictions. This is part of the pointing and calling concept employed by Japanese train staff to improve attentiveness while driving.</div><h2><a id="motivation">Motivation</a></h2><div> There is a whole variety of Japanese train plugins available for BVE Trainsim that can also be used with openBVE. Fortunately, most of them are route-compatible with each other, meaning among other things that beacons have the same meaning or at least non-overlapping assignments. This motivated me to write a plugin that not only supports all major features found in existing plugins, but that is also compatible with them.</div><div> As a consequence, OdakyufanAts is compatible with the plugins used on the Uchibo route, the IIYAMA 2060 route, the SN/P test route and the SW/P2 test route, among many others. This means that you can use trains that employ OdakyufanAts on those routes and enjoy all supported features. It does not mean that you can use OdakyufanAts as a drop-in replacement for other plugins without changing panel and sound configurations. Only the N140 train for the IIYAMA 2060 route is also train-compatible with OdakyufanAts.</div><h2><a id="thesafetysystems">The Safety Systems</a></h2><div> Here you can find the relevant technical details of the various safety systems. These are important for add-ons developers who want to employ any of those safety systems on their routes and trains, and of course for curious users who want to better understand how the systems work.</div><ul class="bullet-plain"><li><a href="atssx.html">ATS-Sx (SN, SF, SK, SS, SW)</a></li><li><a href="atsps.html">ATS-Ps</a></li><li><a href="atc.html">ATC</a></li></ul><h2><a id="developersmanual">Developer's Manual</a></h2><div> Here you can find out how to make your routes and trains ready for use with OdakyufanAts.</div><ul class="bullet-plain"><li><a href="overview.html">Overview on Panel, Sound and Beacons</a></li><li><a href="configuration.html">Train Configuration</a></li></ul><h2><a id="downloads">Downloads</a></h2><div> Includes the binary and the source code.</div><table class="table-grid"><tr><td><span style="font-size:16px; font-weight: bold;"><a href="odakyufanats.7z"><strong>OdakyufanAts 0.9.8</strong></a></span>&nbsp; (49 KB, April 6th 2014)</td></tr></table><div><sub>The plugin is released into the public domain where legally possible.
